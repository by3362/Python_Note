# Python_Note

Now you can add and commit files that you worked on. If you added or deleted files, you must tell Git about them:
```
git rm the-file-i-deleted
git add the-file-i-added
git commit -m "I deleted a file and added a new file."
```
If you only modified files, you can do a one-line commit:
```
git commit -a -m "I modified some existing files."
```
Push
Once you have committed changes, you can push the change set to GitHub:
```
git push
```

! [rejected] master -> master (fetch first)
```
git pull origin master
```
